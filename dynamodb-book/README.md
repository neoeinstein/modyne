# Examples from _The DynamoDB Book_

Within this directory are models based on examples of single-table design
through various levels of complexity as described in [_The DynamoDB Book_][DDB]
by Alex DeBrie.

These models are provided to prove out the functionality of `modyne` while also
being able to serve as tests. It should be relatively simple to reference one of
these crates and build a simple CLI, Web API, or web interface on top of it, as
most of the crates also include implementations of the access patterns described
as requirements in the book.
