# Cargo configuration for the modyne workspace
#
# The modyne crate's doctests require the `derive` feature to be enabled.
# Use one of these commands to run tests:
#   - cargo test --all-features       (runs all tests with all features)
#   - cargo test --features derive    (runs tests with just the derive feature)
#   - cargo test-all                  (alias defined below)

[alias]
# Convenient alias to run tests with all features enabled
test-all = "test --all-features"
